## Pricing & Usage Limits
By default a billing quota cap of $100/billing period across all API endpoints is placed on each account. Invoices are billed every two weeks. If you have a higher quota need than this please reach out to us at team@musicfy.lol, or join our discord server for faster response times.

Each API response for generating audio will be billed at `$0.07/minute` of generated audio. Only succesful API calls will be billed. Any errors will not incur additional charges.

## 403 response
An HTTP 403 response from our servers indicates there is a failed invoice payment. Until all invoices are paid there will be a temporary suspesion of API Access.
