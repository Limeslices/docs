The API only responds to HTTPS-secured communications. Any requests sent via HTTP return an HTTP 301 redirect to the corresponding HTTPS resources.

The API returns request responses in JSON format. When an API request returns an error, it is sent in the JSON response as an error key.

## Authentication
You must include an API key in each request as a `Bearer token` in the `Authorization` header.
